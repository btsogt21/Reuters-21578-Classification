    "This paper aims to tackle the issue of datasets with long-tailed class distributions as well as linkage (co-occurrence) of labels in the context of multi-label text classifiation. This sort of class imbalance occurs when a small subset of labels have many instances (head labels), while the majority of labels (the tail labels) have only a couple instances/examples. This is evident in the Reuters-21578 datset, where the vast majority of documents are occupied by these head labels, while most labels (for example, copper, strategic metal, and nickel) appear in less than 5% of the training data. Co-occurrence/label linkage is a challenge when some head (common) labels seem to coincide with rare or tail labels. In such cases, the model tends to be biased in terms of classifying the documents to the common labels. Some solutions, such as samples with less frequent labels in classification, using co-occurrence information in model initialization, and hybrid solutions for head and tail categories with multi-task architecture have been proposed, but they are not suitable for imbalanced datasets or are dependent on the model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, the authors are introducing the use of balancing loss function for multi label text classification. They work with two datasets: the aforementioned Reuters-21578 dataset, as well as another one called the PubMed dataset. For both datasets the proposed distribution balancing methods outperform other loss functions for total metrics and lead to significant improvement for classifying on tail labels.  "

    "As you can see from the above, rare labels are assigned increasingly positive $v_i$, whereas common labels are assigned increasingly negative $v_i$. Let's continue this exercise by examining the $q_i^k$ for each example document, in both the positive and the negative classification case (that is, the case where the prediction should indeed be closer to 'yes' for a given label i, and the case where the prediction should be closer to 'no' for a given label i). \n",

    "As you can see from the above, when using the NTR-FL loss function's method for calculating probabilities in the positive case, the way the logit is changed depends on whether the label is rare, uncommon, or common, with rarer labels having their logits artificially reduced, and common labels having their logits artificially increased. Smaller and smaller logits cause the calculated probabilities to be lower and lower (note, the negative sign in the exponent is not part of the logit when considering the logit's value). Consequently, with lower probabilities, there will be a greater loss, a greater penalty, and stronger gradient updates toward better predicting true positives for rare labels. Conversely, in the case of very common labels, you can see that the logits are increased. Larger logits cause the calculated probabilities to be higher, and thus cause the loss to be smaller. Therefore, gradient updates focusing on predicting true positives for common labels are less pronounced.\n",

    "The difference here is the presence of the $\\lambda$ term. Similar to the $\\beta$ term from the rebalanced FL loss function discussed earlier, this introduces an amplifier that influences the 'steepness' of the sigmoid function, with >1 values causing the sigmoid to be far steeper around the inflection point, 0<lambda<1 values causing the sigmoid function to be far less steep, 0 causing the sigmoid to flatline, and values below 0 following the same pattern but in the inverse. The impact of this is that small deviations in the logit will lead to larger changes in the predicted probability away from the inflection point, which, consequently, will cause larger changes in the loss (as in what would have high loss before will have even higher loss, and what would have had lower loss would have had even lower loss). However, given that the final loss calculation also has a $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ term, we can't immediately say that what would have had high loss before will have even higher loss, and what would have had lower loss would have even lower loss. The loss is scaled down by a factor of $\\lambda$, and that can cause for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\log(1-(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\lambda\\times1)}}))\\div\\lambda \\approx \\frac{-2.127}{\\lambda} \\approx 1.063$\n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\log(1-(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(1)}})) \\approx 1.313$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, without the lambda division, the lambda amplification by 2x in the exponent of the $e$ causes a larger loss. However, with the lambda division, the loss goes down by double in the upper case, and thus the final loss is actually less than what the lower case has.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that for correct negative predictions, the loss remains small and only gets smaller by a factor of lambda, whereas for incorrect negative predictions, the loss will initially be smaller than if lambda was not involved in either the exponent or as divisor in the loss function, but then levels out as the loss grows greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the impact of these adjustments (including the adjustments to the logit calculation with $v_i$) in the negative case is that the model is less penalized for incorrectly predicting negative instances of rare classes, and more penalized for incorrectly predicting negative instances of common classes. Thus, the model is encouraged to focus on correctly classifying positive instances of rare classes, and encouraged to maintain high accuracy on common classes."

This split is partitioned such that 7769 of the documents are used for training (1000 of which went into validation), and 3019 for testing. The labels are nearly equally split into head (30 with $\\geq$ 35 associated documents), medium (31 with 8-35 associated documents), and tail (30 with $\\leq$ 8 associated documents)."

The external helper functions in the module are for reducing and weighting the loss, as well as for computing the BCE. Since reimplementation of this module from scratch would be rather tedious, we've just gone ahead and downloaded the util_loss.py function directly from the Huang et al. repo."

    "Although we did not finish training and evaluation, we can see that the Huang et al. pipeline performs better in Micro-F1 within 4 epochs of training, relative to my old pipeline which performed worse after 5 epochs of training on the same metric. This discrepancy can probably be chalked up to a number of factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Threshold tuning for Optimal F1 Score. My pipeline uses a fixed threshold score of 0.5 to convert predicted probabilities into binary labels. We did not attempt to explore or adjust threshold values during evaluation. On the other hand, Huang et al.'s pipeline utilizes dynamic threshold tuning after each epoch in order to maximize F1 score on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Higher learning rate. In my original pipeline, I utilized a learning rate of 2e-5, which is five times lower than the learning rate used in the Huang et al. pipeline. The fact that they have a learning rate of 1e-4 probably speeds up the model's convergence, allowing it to reach better performance levels in fewer epochs. Theoretically, my model might have caught up if we had let it run for many more epochs, but this is something we will have to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grouping parameters into those with and without weight decay. In my original pipeline, I applied weight decay universally. On the other hand, Huang et al. utilizes grouping to discriminate between those weights that should and should not have weight decay. They use the recommended grouping from huggingface's documentation, applying weight decay to all weights EXCEPT those marked with 'bias' and 'LayerNorm.weight'. This probably allowed Huang et al.'s pipeline to have more effective optimization for weights relative to my pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Batch size. Originally, I used a batch size of 16 for training. When replicating the Huang et al. pipeline, however, I increased the batch size to 32. This higher batch size probably lead to faster convergence as well. I will have to test my original pipeline with a similar batch size later.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use of learning rate scheduler. I utilized a learning rate scheduler in my original pipeline. The replication of Huang et al. did not. This likely contributed to faster convergence for the Huang et al. pipeline as well, especially considering the fact that we had a lower learning rate -> lead to slower convergence for initial pipeline -> less risk of overshooting minima, especially with few epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have finished testing Huang et al.'s methodology, especially the loss functions adjusted for class imbalance and label co-occurrence, I will have to adopt the above changes to my original pipeline and see just how much the performance will improve."
